# intro-component-with-signup-form-2

So, main objective of this challenge was to make a functional signup form.
I did my best to make it work.
I am still not sure if it works well on all screens
because when using dev tools it looks good but when I uploaded it to
netlifiy it looked like it had some problems. Maybe in future
projects I will be able to fix this.

About the challenge, all input forms should be able to let you know
when the first name, last name, email and password are valid or invalid.

I managed to change the border of inputs when thay are valid to green and
change it to red when they are invalid, and also if the input fields are empty
placeholder notifies you they shouldn't be empty.

This was a tough challenge but I managed to make it work, more or less.
I used loop and if/else if methods.
In the end I am proud of this project because I had to put in a lot of effort to finish it and it wasn't easy. 

In the next challenges I plan to use some new and different methods so I can practise with other stuff too.
